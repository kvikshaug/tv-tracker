          The series you're currently watching. Displayed with a large poster, and makes it easy to increase which
          episode you last saw.

          Other series you like, but you're not currently watching. Maybe you're waiting for the next episode to air, or
          you're just taking a break for now.

          Series you've finished. Placing them here instead of removing them completely lets you keep a list of those
          classic series you liked. Perhaps it's time to re-watch <em>The Wire</em>?
